# K-Wav2vec 2.0

This official implementation of ["K-Wav2vec 2.0: Automatic Speech Recognition based on Joint Decoding of Graphemes and Syllables"](https://arxiv.org/abs/2110.05172)

## Requirements and Installation

 - PyTorch version >= 1.7.1
 - Python version >= 3.6
 - To install K-wav2vec and develop locally:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/JoungheeKim/K-wav2vec.git
cd K-wav2vec

## install essential library
pip install -r requirements.txt

## install locally
python setup.py develop
```
 - We only test this implementation in Ubuntu 18.04.
 - DockerFile is also supported in this repo.


## Instructions
 - We support script examples to execute code easily(check `script` folder)
 - Following this instruction give you exact matched results.
```bash
# Guilde to make multi-model with Ksponspeech(orthographic transcription) 

# [1] preprocess dataset & make manifest
bash script/preprocess/make_ksponspeech_script_for_mulitmodel.sh

# [2] further pre-train the model
bash script/pretrain/run_further_pretrain.sh
 
# [3] fine-tune the model
bash script/finetune/run_ksponspeech_multimodel.sh

# [4] inference the model
bash script/inference/evaluate_multimodel.sh
```


## Pretrained model
 - E-Wav2vec 2.0 : Wav2vec 2.0 pretrained on Englsih dataset released by Fairseq(-py)
 - K-Wav2vec 2.0 : The model further pretrained on Ksponspeech by using Englsih model
    - Fairseq Version : If you want to fine-tune your model with fairseq framework, you can download with this [LINK](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1XJJ6A3xEMLjRbaO4z9FI-RP84fA4pvep/view?usp=sharing)
    - Huggingface Version : If you want to fine-tune your model with huggingface framework, you can download with this [LINK](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1Jm3-oylhjAdNjtZUQv-3uFAt0OMjLhJH/view?usp=sharing)


## Dataset
 - [Ksponspeech](https://aihub.or.kr/aidata/105) : Open-domain dialog corpus
